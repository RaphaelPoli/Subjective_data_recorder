# Subjective_data_recorder
This is a data recorder coded for lucid dream practice. It can be adapted for any subjective frequent data input.
The principle is just a wx interface related to a xls file.
Procedures in there can be usefull for any data collection, subjective data but also measures with arduino.


The observation already plays a good role in improving the practice. A whole load of statistics are possible along the collected data that represents 35 variables in each row. Many rows a day is possible but the app is optimised for one row a day. 


Please use the xls file provided. It should be in the same directory than the python file.
